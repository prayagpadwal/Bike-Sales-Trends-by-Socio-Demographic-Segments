## Project Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of bicycle purchasing behavior across various socio-demographic segments. The aim is to unveil the correlation between bike purchases 🛒 and factors such as income 💰, age 👵👶, and commuting distance 🏘️➡️🏢.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset was first cleansed to ensure data quality and accuracy:
- **Duplicate Removal**: Identified and eliminated duplicate records 🚫📄.
- **Null Value Treatment**: Performed checks and handled missing values to maintain data integrity 🔍.
- **Acronym Clarification**: Defined acronyms in two key columns for better comprehension 📚.

## Feature Engineering
- **Age Brackets**: Derived from the 'Age' column to segment the data more meaningfully 📊.

## Analysis
The core analysis was conducted through detailed pivot tables:
- **Average Income by Gender & Bike Purchase Status**: Explored the relationship between average income and bike purchasing habits, segmented by gender 👫💵.
- **Bike Purchase Count by Distance from Point**: Analyzed the frequency of bike purchases in relation to commute distance from a central reference point 🛣️🚲.
- **Bike Purchases by Age Group**: Examined age-related trends in bicycle purchasing 📈.

## Dashboard Creation
A comprehensive dashboard was created using the aforementioned pivot tables. Key features of the dashboard include:
- **Interactive Filters**: Filters based on 'Marital Status,' 'Region,' and 'Education' allow for dynamic exploration of the data 🔍🌍🎓.
- **Slicer**: Utilized for seamless navigation through different data segments 🔪.
- **Pivot Table Analyzer**: Enabled the examination of pivot table data from various perspectives 🔬.
- **Filter Connections**: All pivot tables were interconnected with dashboard filters for integrated data analysis 🔗.

## Visualization and Alignment
Data visualizations were carefully aligned and formatted to ensure a user-friendly interface and professional presentation of the data 📊🎨.

## Conclusions
The project reveals significant insights into the demographic and economic factors that influence bicycle purchasing decisions 🤔🚲. The findings can serve as a foundation for further research or be leveraged by stakeholders to make informed decisions 🎯.
